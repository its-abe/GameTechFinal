# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2024

## Theme
Reverse
We thought about reversing controls, but we wanted something more. We adding a gravity reversal feature to further complement the theme.

## Game Play
Objective: Get to the end of the level
Instructions: Use your arrow keys to move, Space to switch the gravity, LShift to jump.

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
Github usage became difficult towards the end because we were all trying to finish our parts. The amount of time was also a hindrance, but was a fun challenge in seeing what we could accomplish.
